# Contributing

Controbutions are  welcome.

In order not to blow this repo up with fairly special snippets that aren't of any general use, please first open up an issue to discuss any proposals. Same goes for fixes to existing snippets.

## Guidelines

Please obey these guidelines:
- Stick to the **Singleton Manager Class / Static Info Struct** structure of this repo. For snippets that don't fit into this scheme, have a look at [HandySwift](https://github.com/Flinesoft/HandySwift) and [HandyUIKit](https://github.com/Flinesoft/HandyUIKit) where they could possibly fit instead.
- For **commit messages**:
    - Follow the syntax described [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- For **new files or additions**:
    - Follow the file structure guide described [here](http://bestpractices.jamitlabs.com/t/file-structure-use-of-mark/84).
    - Don't produce any SwiftLint warnings or errors.
- For **file headers** in Swift source files, use the following format:
```swift
//
//  [File Title].swift
//  SwiftySnippets[Tests]
//
//  Created by [Your Name] on [Day (2 digits)].[Month (2 digits)].[Year (2 digits)].
//  Released as a part of SwiftySnippets. https://www.github.com/piknotech/SwiftySnippets
//
```
